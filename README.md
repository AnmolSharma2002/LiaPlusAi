<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6;">
  <h2 style="color: #4CAF50;">Project Description 🌟</h2>
  
  <p><strong>Blogify</strong> is a secure blog platform that implements a <strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</strong> system to manage different user roles such as <strong>admin</strong> and <strong>user</strong>. The application ensures only authorized users have access to certain functionalities like creating, updating, and deleting blog posts based on their role. 🌐</p>
  
  <p>The backend is built with <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>Express.js</strong>, handling <strong>authentication via JWT</strong> and role-based authorization to maintain security and prevent unauthorized access. 🔐</p>
  
  <h3 style="color: #2196F3;">Key Features 🚀</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>🔑 <strong>User Authentication:</strong> Secure login and signup process using JWT tokens.</li>
    <li>🔒 <strong>Role-Based Authorization:</strong> Admins have full access to manage blog posts, while users can only view them.</li>
    <li>📝 <strong>Admin Dashboard:</strong> A powerful interface for admins to create, update, and delete blog posts.</li>
    <li>🌐 <strong>User Interface:</strong> A modern and user-friendly frontend built with <strong>React</strong>.</li>
    <li>💾 <strong>Database:</strong> Uses <strong>MongoDB</strong> or <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> for storing user roles, blog posts, and user information.</li>
    <li>📧 <strong>Email Verification:</strong> (Optional) Email verification during signup to enhance account security.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>This project provides a comprehensive solution for managing blog content with role-based access, ensuring each user has appropriate permissions. Whether you’re an admin or a regular user, the platform ensures a seamless and secure experience. 🔑💻</p>

## Backend Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the application on your local machine:

### Step 1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
   ```
### Step 2: **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd project-name
   ```
### Step 3: **Install dependencies**

After navigating to your project directory, the next step is to install the project dependencies.

To do this, you can use either **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **yarn** (an alternative package manager).

#### Using **npm**:

If you're using **npm**, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm install
# OR
yarn install
```
### Step 4: **Set up environment variables**

Before running the application, you need to configure environment variables. These variables store sensitive data such as API keys, database connection strings, and other configuration details.

1. **Create a `.env` file** in the root of your project.

2. **Add required environment variables** to the `.env` file. For example:

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
EMAIL=your-email@example.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-email-password
PORT=5000
```
Replace the placeholder values (your-database, your-jwt-secret, etc.) with actual values specific to your application.

Make sure not to commit the .env file to version control (e.g., Git) to keep sensitive information safe. Add the .env file to your .gitignore file.
```bash
echo .env >> .gitignore
```
This ensures your environment variables are not exposed publicly.

### Step 5: **Start the Application**

Once you’ve installed the dependencies and set up the environment variables, you can start the application.

1. **Start the application:**

   Use the following command to start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the server and you should see a message indicating that the server is running on the specified port.

Alternatively, if you are in development mode:

You can use npm run dev to start the application with nodemon, which will automatically restart the server whenever you make changes to the code.
```bash
   npm run dev
```
Access the application:

Open your browser and go to:
```ardunio
http://localhost:5000
```
The server should now be running locally, and you can begin using the application.
